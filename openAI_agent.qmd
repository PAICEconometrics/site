# ü§ñ Paper Hunter: Your Intelligent Research Assistant

Discover how we created a customized GPT agent that **automatically** searches, filters, and delivers the most relevant scientific articles every week, every Friday at 8 AM.
:::

---

## üìã Project Overview

In the context of an active research project on **applied econometrics and multi-period multi-objective optimization**, staying updated with the latest literature is fundamental but extremely time-consuming. Every week, dozens of new papers emerge in repositories like arXiv, SSRN, and scientific journals.

**Our solution?** Create a personalized intelligent agent in ChatGPT that:

- üîç **Automatically searches** across multiple scientific databases
- üìä **Filters and categorizes** articles by relevance
- üìß **Delivers weekly** structured reports
- ‚è∞ **Scheduled delivery**: Every Friday at 08:00 AM (Bras√≠lia time)

## üéØ Paper Hunter Objectives

### Identified Problem

Researchers and students face challenges such as:

1. **Information overload**: Hundreds of papers published weekly
2. **Source dispersion**: ArXiv, SSRN, Google Scholar, journals, etc.
3. **Time constraints**: Difficulty keeping up with recent literature
4. **Sharing difficulties**: Need for an easy format to disseminate to students

### Implemented Solution

We developed **Paper Hunter**, a customized GPT agent that:

- Performs targeted searches in specific scientific databases
- Applies quality and relevance filters
- Generates structured reports in shareable format
- Operates completely autonomously

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Created Paper Hunter

### Step 1: GPT Agent Configuration

We accessed ChatGPT and created a **personalized GPT** with the following specifications:

::: {.callout-note}
## Accessing GPT Builder
To create personalized GPTs, you need a ChatGPT Plus or Team account. Access: **Settings ‚Üí Explore GPTs ‚Üí Create a GPT**
:::

**Main instructions provided to the agent:**

```markdown
You are an agent specialized in weekly scientific curation.

OBJECTIVE:
Search weekly for recent scientific articles on:
- Applied econometrics
- Multi-period multi-objective optimization
- Time series forecasting
- Reinforcement learning applied to finance
- Commodity volatility modeling

SEARCH SCOPE:
- Databases: arXiv (econ.EM, q-fin, cs.LG), SSRN, Google Scholar
- Period: Last 7 days (articles AND preprints)
- Language: English
- Focus: Papers with finance/economics applications

DELIVERY FORMAT:
1. Structured table (Excel-ready)
2. Columns: Date | Title | Authors | Venue/Type | Link | Summary | Category
3. Categories: Econometrics, Optimization, RL, Volatility
4. Direct and functional links
5. Concise summary (1-2 sentences) in Portuguese

FREQUENCY:
Every Friday at 08:00 AM (Bras√≠lia time)
```

### Step 2: Integration with Search Tools

Paper Hunter uses multiple search strategies:

#### 2.1 ArXiv API
```python
# Example query on arXiv
search_query = "multi-objective portfolio optimization"
categories = "econ.EM OR q-fin.PM OR q-fin.RM OR cs.LG"
date_filter = "submittedDate:[last_week TO now]"
```

#### 2.2 SSRN Working Papers
- Search by specific keywords
- Filter by publication date
- Metadata extraction

#### 2.3 Google Scholar
- Targeted queries with Boolean operators
- Temporal filter: "Since 2025" + sort by date
- PDF availability verification

#### 2.4 Consensus AI
Specialized academic search tool that:
- Accesses +200M papers
- Uses GPT-4 for semantic analysis
- Provides automatic insights and citations

## üìä Example of Weekly Output

Here's a real example of Paper Hunter's output:

::: {.info-box}
### üìÖ Week of 09/05/2025

| Date | Title | Authors | Category | Link |
|------|-------|---------|----------|------|
| 2025-09-03 | Neural L√©vy SDE for State-Dependent Risk and Density Forecasting | Z. Wang; S.T. Rachev | Econometrics; Volatility | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01041) |

## ‚è∞ Setting Up Automatic Scheduling

### Method 1: Scheduled Actions in ChatGPT (Recommended)

ChatGPT Team/Enterprise offers native **Scheduled Actions**:

1. Access your personalized GPT
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Actions**
3. Configure:
   - **Trigger**: Every Friday at 08:00 AM (America/Sao_Paulo)
   - **Action**: Run research query and send results
   - **Notification**: Email to team members

::: {.callout-tip}
## Free Alternative
If you don't have access to ChatGPT Team, you can use **Zapier** or **Make.com** to automate calls to the OpenAI API at specific times.
:::

### Method 2: Automation via Zapier

```yaml
Trigger: Schedule by Zapier
  - Frequency: Weekly
  - Day: Friday
  - Time: 08:00 AM (GMT-3)

Action: OpenAI (GPT-4)
  - Model: gpt-4
  - Prompt: "Run Paper Hunter weekly search"
  - Send results to: Email / Slack / Google Sheets
```

## üìÅ Generating Shareable Spreadsheets

To facilitate sharing via WhatsApp with students, we configured the agent to automatically generate a **consolidated Excel spreadsheet**:

### Spreadsheet Structure

**Master File:** `literature_master.xlsx`

**Sheets:**
1. **Index** - Index of all weeks
2. **All** - All consolidated articles
3. **2025-09-05** - Articles from specific week
4. **2025-09-12** - Next week
5. (continues...)

### Table Columns

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Week** | Reference Friday | 2025-09-05 |
| **Date** | Submission date | 2025-09-03 |
| **Title** | Article title | Neural L√©vy SDE for... |
| **Authors** | Authors | Z. Wang; S.T. Rachev |

## üí° Best Practices and Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Query specificity**: The more specific the prompt, the better the results
2. **Temporal filters**: Always include 7-day windows to avoid duplicates
3. **Multiple sources**: Combining arXiv + SSRN + Scholar increases coverage
4. **Structured format**: Tables greatly facilitate sharing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

1. **False positives**: Some articles are not as relevant as they seem
2. **Indexing delay**: Very recent papers may not appear
3. **Access limitations**: Some journals have paywalls
4. **Ambiguous categorization**: Interdisciplinary papers require manual review

### üîß Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement automatic relevance score (0-10)
- [ ] Add LLM-generated summaries of abstracts
- [ ] Create alerts for high-impact papers
- [ ] Integrate with Zotero/Mendeley for reference management
- [ ] Interactive dashboard with visualizations
