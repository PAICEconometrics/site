## üìä Planned Publications by Type

### üéì Journal Articles

Our research aims to contribute to high-impact journals in the fields of agricultural finance, econometrics, and computational intelligence. We target journals with strong reputations in quantitative finance and agricultural commodities research.

---

#### **Article 1: Multi-Period Portfolio Optimization with MSGARCH and Reinforcement Learning**

::: {.info-box}
**üìå Provisional Title**  
*"Dynamic Portfolio Management of Agricultural Commodities: Integrating Markov-Switching GARCH Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"*

**üéØ Research Objectives**

- Develop a novel framework combining MSGARCH volatility forecasting with multi-period portfolio optimization
- Implement Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents for dynamic rebalancing strategies
- Compare performance against traditional mean-variance optimization under regime-switching conditions
- Validate the methodology using Brazilian agricultural commodity data (corn, soy, wheat, coffee, sugar)

**üìê Methodology Summary**

The proposed research integrates three interconnected methodological pillars. First, we employ Markov-Switching GARCH models to capture volatility regime transitions in commodity returns, explicitly modeling the time-varying nature of agricultural market volatility. Second, we implement multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II and Differential Evolution algorithms to generate Pareto-efficient portfolios balancing return maximization, risk minimization, and liquidity considerations. Third, we deploy reinforcement learning agents trained to select optimal portfolio weights dynamically across different market regimes, learning adaptive rebalancing strategies through interaction with historical market data.

**üìä Expected Contributions**

- **Methodological Innovation**: First integration of MSGARCH with multi-agent RL for commodity portfolio management
- **Practical Application**: Actionable framework for agricultural portfolio managers and trading desks
- **Theoretical Advancement**: Extension of regime-switching models to multi-period optimization contexts
- **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive backtesting on 10+ years of Brazilian commodity data

**üéØ Target Journals** (in order of preference)

1. **Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control** (Elsevier) - Q1, IF: 1.9
2. **Quantitative Finance** (Taylor & Francis) - Q1, IF: 1.5
