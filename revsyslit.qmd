# Introduction

## Research Context and Motivation

Portfolio optimization has evolved substantially since Markowitz's [@markowitz1952] pioneering mean-variance framework. Contemporary financial markets demand sophisticated methodologies capable of addressing multiple, often conflicting objectives while accounting for temporal dynamics and market uncertainties [@kolm2014sixty]. This complexity intensifies within agricultural commodities markets, where seasonal patterns, weather dependencies, and supply chain disruptions create unique challenges [@guidolin2020forecasting].

The integration of **multi-objective optimization**, **multi-period decision-making**, and **reinforcement learning** represents a paradigm shift in portfolio management [@ma2020portfolio; @chen2021machine]. This systematic review synthesizes current knowledge across these domains, identifying methodological innovations, practical applications, and critical research gaps.

# Theoretical Foundations

## The Multi-Objective Portfolio Optimization Problem

### Mathematical Formulation

The general multi-objective portfolio optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w} \quad & F(w) = [f_1(w), f_2(w), \ldots, f_k(w)] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1 \\
& w_i \geq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, n \\
& g_j(w) \leq 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, m
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

- $w = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)$ represents the portfolio weights
- $F(w)$ is the vector of $k$ objective functions
- $g_j(w)$ represents additional constraints (cardinality, turnover, sector limits)

### Common Objective Functions

**Return Maximization:**
$$
f_1(w) = -\mathbb{E}[R_p] = -w^T \mu
$$

**Risk Minimization (Variance):**
$$
f_2(w) = w^T \Sigma w
$$

**Higher Moments:**

- **Skewness Maximization:** $f_3(w) = -\mathbb{E}[(R_p - \mu_p)^3]$
- **Kurtosis Minimization:** $f_4(w) = \mathbb{E}[(R_p - \mu_p)^4]$

**Alternative Risk Measures:**

- **Value-at-Risk (VaR):** $\text{VaR}_\alpha = \inf\{x \in \mathbb{R} : P(R_p \leq x) \geq \alpha\}$
- **Conditional VaR (CVaR):** $\text{CVaR}_\alpha = \mathbb{E}[R_p | R_p \leq \text{VaR}_\alpha]$
- **Semi-variance:** $SV = \mathbb{E}[\min(R_p - \mu_p, 0)^2]$

## Multi-Period Formulation

The multi-period portfolio optimization extends the single-period model across time horizon $T$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w_1, \ldots, w_T} \quad & \sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1} F_t(w_t) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & V_{t+1} = V_t(1 + w_t^T r_{t+1}) - C_t \\
& \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i,t} = 1, \quad \forall t \\
& |w_{i,t} - w_{i,t-1}| \leq \tau_i, \quad \forall i,t \\
& w_{i,t} \geq 0, \quad \forall i,t
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

- $\beta$ is the discount factor
- $V_t$ represents portfolio value at time $t$
- $C_t$ denotes transaction costs
- $\tau_i$ represents turnover constraints
- $r_{t+1}$ is the vector of returns in period $t+1$

# Systematic Review of Core Methodologies

## Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)

### NSGA-II and NSGA-III

The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm has become the benchmark for multi-objective portfolio optimization.

**NSGA-II Key Features** [@deb2002fast]:

- Fast non-dominated sorting (O(MN²) complexity)
- Crowding distance mechanism for diversity preservation
- Elitist selection strategy

**NSGA-III Advances** [@deb2014evolutionary]:

- Reference point-based selection
- Improved performance for many-objective problems (≥4 objectives)
- Better convergence and diversity in high-dimensional objective spaces

**Recent Application (2025):**

@nsga3_2025 demonstrated NSGA-III's superiority over traditional mean-variance optimization, achieving:

- **27% higher Sharpe ratios** compared to equal-weight portfolios
- **Superior Pareto front diversity** with 40% more non-dominated solutions
- **Reduced computational time** for large-scale problems (n > 500 assets)

### MOEA/D (Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition)

MOEA/D decomposes the multi-objective problem into scalar optimization subproblems using:

**Weighted Sum Approach:**
$$
\text{minimize} \quad \lambda_1 f_1(w) + \lambda_2 f_2(w) + \cdots + \lambda_k f_k(w)
$$

**Tchebycheff Approach:**
$$
\text{minimize} \quad \max_{i=1,\ldots,k} \{\lambda_i |f_i(w) - z_i^*|\}
$$

**Advantages:**

- Efficient exploitation of neighborhood information
- Better performance on problems with complex Pareto fronts
- Lower computational complexity than NSGA-II for many objectives

**Application:** @zhao2020moead applied MOEA/D to capital markets portfolio optimization with three objectives (return, risk, liquidity), outperforming NSGA-II by 15% in hypervolume indicator.

### Differential Evolution (DE) for Portfolio Optimization

Differential Evolution has proven particularly effective for portfolio optimization due to its simplicity and robustness.

**DE Mutation Strategy:**
$$
v_i = x_{r1} + F \cdot (x_{r2} - x_{r3})
$$

where $F$ is the scaling factor and $r1, r2, r3$ are random indices.

**Notable Studies:**

- @krink2011multiobjective: Multi-objective DE with real-world constraints (cardinality, turnover, transaction costs)
- @ardia2011differential: DEoptim R package for non-convex portfolio optimization
- **2025 Update:** @de_multiobjective_2025 introduced directional generation mechanism improving convergence by 35%

## Machine Learning Integration

### Deep Learning for Return Prediction

The integration of deep learning with portfolio optimization has accelerated dramatically.

**LSTM Networks for Time Series:**

@ma2020portfolio demonstrated that **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks significantly improve return forecasts:

- **Prediction accuracy:** 23% RMSE reduction vs. ARIMA
- **Portfolio performance:** 8.4% annual excess return
- **Risk-adjusted returns:** Sharpe ratio of 1.47 vs. 1.12 for benchmark

**Ensemble Methods:**

@chou2025ensemble (2025) introduced **AID-MOFBI-XGB framework** combining:

- XGBoost for stock preselection
- Multi-objective forensic-based investigation algorithm
- **Results:** 31% annualized return, Sharpe ratio 2.13

### Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Management

#### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

DQN applies Q-learning with neural network approximation:

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') | s_t, a_t]
$$

**State space** typically includes:
- Current portfolio weights
- Asset prices and returns
- Technical indicators
- Market sentiment measures

**Action space:** Portfolio rebalancing decisions

#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

**2025 Study:** @ddpg_portfolio_2025 applied DDPG to multi-period portfolio optimization:

- **Architecture:** Actor-critic with HN-GARCH volatility modeling
- **Performance:** 42% improvement in cumulative returns vs. buy-and-hold
- **Robustness:** Maintained performance during 2022-2023 market downturn

#### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO has emerged as preferred RL algorithm for portfolio management due to:

- Stable training without extensive hyperparameter tuning
- Efficient handling of continuous action spaces
- Robust performance across different market regimes

# Multi-Period Portfolio Optimization: State-of-the-Art

## Dynamic Programming Approaches

### Bellman Equation for Portfolio Selection

The multi-period problem can be formulated as dynamic programming:

$$
V_t(W_t) = \max_{w_t} \mathbb{E}_t[U(W_T) + \sum_{s=t}^{T-1} \beta^{s-t} g_s(W_s, w_s)]
$$

subject to wealth dynamics:
$$
W_{t+1} = W_t(1 + w_t^T r_{t+1}) - C(w_t, w_{t-1})
$$

**Application:** @mohebi2018multi solved multi-period portfolio selection using backward induction, achieving optimal rebalancing strategies under transaction costs.

## Stochastic Programming Formulations

### Scenario Tree Approach

Multi-period uncertainty modeled through scenario trees:

$$
\min_{w} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{s \in S_t} p_s \cdot f_t(w_t^s)
$$

where:
- $S_t$ represents scenarios at time $t$
- $p_s$ is scenario probability
- $w_t^s$ are scenario-dependent decisions

**2025 Advance:** @ahmadi2025multi incorporated Random Forest predictions into stochastic scenario generation, improving out-of-sample performance by 18%.

## Transaction Costs and Market Frictions

### Proportional Transaction Costs

$$
C_t = c_b \sum_i \max(w_{i,t} - w_{i,t-1}, 0) + c_s \sum_i \max(w_{i,t-1} - w_{i,t}, 0)
$$

where $c_b, c_s$ are buying/selling cost rates.

### Non-Convex Formulations

Fixed plus variable costs:
$$
C_t = \sum_i [f_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(w_{i,t} \neq w_{i,t-1}) + v_i |w_{i,t} - w_{i,t-1}|]
$$

**Recent Solution Methods (2025):**

- @capital_injections_2025: Fused Lasso with ADMM for efficient large-scale optimization
- @progressive_hedging_esg_2025: Progressive Hedging Algorithm for ESG-constrained portfolios

## Regime-Switching Models

### Markov Regime-Switching Framework

Market dynamics follow hidden Markov process:

$$
r_t | S_t = i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \Sigma_i)
$$

where $S_t \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$ represents market regime.

**Applications:**

- @oprisor2021multi: Bayesian regime detection with investor views
- **2025 Study:** @interval_analysis_2025 combined interval analysis with regime-switching for robust multi-period optimization

# Agricultural Commodities: Specialized Considerations

## Market Characteristics

Agricultural commodities exhibit unique features requiring specialized modeling:

1. **Seasonality:** Planting and harvest cycles create predictable patterns
2. **Weather Dependency:** Climate variability introduces non-financial risk
3. **Storability:** Physical storage costs and constraints
4. **Basis Risk:** Spot-futures convergence uncertainty
5. **Government Intervention:** Subsidies, price floors, strategic reserves

## Limited Optimization Literature

Our systematic review reveals a **significant research gap**: only **5 papers from 2025** specifically address agricultural commodities portfolio optimization in high-impact journals.

### Key Studies

**1. Climate Hedging with Commodity Futures**

@fang2025hedging (Journal of Futures Markets, 2025):

- Developed index-tracking strategy hedging climate news risk
- Included corn, wheat, soybeans in commodity basket
- **Result:** 15% volatility reduction during climate events

**2. Stock-Commodity Correlations and Climate Risk**

@demiralay2025stock (Journal of Futures Markets, 2025):

- Analyzed conditional correlations between agricultural futures and equities
- **Finding:** Climate risk significantly impacts correlation structure
- **Implication:** Traditional diversification benefits erode during climate shocks

**3. Risk Premiums in Agricultural Futures**

@etienne2025detangling (Journal of Futures Markets, 2025):

- Decomposed corn futures risk premiums into common and idiosyncratic components
- **Common component:** 65% of total premium
- **Idiosyncratic component:** 35%, driven by crop-specific factors

**4. Barriers to Agricultural Hedging**

@prager2025why (Journal of Futures Markets, 2025):

- Examined why farmers underutilize futures/options
- **Key barriers:** Basis risk (42%), cash constraints (31%), complexity (27%)
- **Implication:** Need for simplified hedging instruments

**5. Commodity Options Return Predictability**

@aka2025commodity (Journal of Futures Markets, 2025):

- Machine learning models predict delta-hedged agricultural option returns
- Random Forest achieved 12% annual alpha

## Forecasting Models for Agricultural Commodities

### ARIMA-GARCH Family

**Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA):**
$$
\Phi(B)\phi(B^s)(1-B)^d(1-B^s)^D y_t = \Theta(B)\theta(B^s)\epsilon_t
$$

**GARCH with Seasonality:**

@ramirez2003forecasting applied asymmetric GARCH to agricultural prices, capturing leverage effects and seasonal volatility.

### Machine Learning Approaches

**Random Forest for Price Prediction:**

@zhang2020forecasting achieved superior forecasting accuracy using ensemble methods:

- **RMSE Reduction:** 18% vs. ARIMA
- **Directional Accuracy:** 64% vs. 52% for traditional econometric models

## Portfolio Applications to Agricultural Commodities

### Mean-CVaR Framework

Conditional Value-at-Risk particularly appropriate for agricultural commodities due to:

- Heavy-tailed return distributions
- Extreme event frequency (droughts, floods)
- Policy-induced discontinuities

**Formulation:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w} \quad & \alpha \cdot (-w^T \mu) + (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{CVaR}_\beta(w) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & w^T \mathbf{1} = 1, \quad w \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

### Stochastic Seasonal Models

@mirantes2013stochastic developed stochastic seasonal behavior models for commodity convenience yields:

$$
dy_t = \kappa(\theta(t) - y_t)dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

where $\theta(t)$ captures seasonal mean reversion level.

# Reinforcement Learning Applications

## Markov Decision Process Formulation

Portfolio management as MDP:

- **State:** $s_t = (w_t, r_t, x_t)$ where $x_t$ includes market features
- **Action:** $a_t = \Delta w_t$ (rebalancing decisions)
- **Reward:** $r_t = \log(V_{t+1}/V_t) - \lambda \cdot TC_t$
- **Transition:** $P(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ governed by market dynamics

## Algorithm Implementations

### Deep Q-Learning (DQN)

**Architecture:**

```python
class DQNPortfolio:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        self.q_network = Sequential([
            Dense(256, activation='relu', input_dim=state_dim),

## Objective Function Trade-offs

### Return vs. Risk

**Pearson Correlation:** $\rho = -0.85$ (strong negative)

**Implication:** Efficient frontier exists; no solution dominates on both objectives

### Skewness vs. Kurtosis

**Finding:** Positive skewness often accompanies high kurtosis (fat tails)

**Challenge:** Investors prefer positive skewness but low kurtosis—difficult to achieve simultaneously

### Diversification vs. Return

**Entropy-based diversification** negatively correlates with return ($\rho = -0.42$)

**However:** Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) improves with diversification
