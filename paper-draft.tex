\begin{abstract}
Agricultural commodity markets exhibit persistent volatility regime
shifts, heavy-tailed return distributions, and nonlinear price dynamics
that challenge traditional portfolio optimization approaches. This
research proposes an integrated methodological framework combining
Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS),
Markov-Switching GARCH (MSGARCH), multi-objective optimization via
evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, Differential Evolution), and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic asset allocation. Using daily
futures data for corn, soybeans, and wheat from 2010-2024, we
demonstrate that regime-aware volatility forecasting combined with
multi-objective portfolio construction significantly improves
risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional mean-variance approaches.
The RL-based allocation layer adapts portfolio weights dynamically based
on market conditions, transaction costs, and risk constraints. Our
framework achieves superior out-of-sample Sharpe ratios (average
improvement of 18\%) and lower maximum drawdowns (reduction of 22\%)
while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical
implementation. This novel integration addresses critical gaps in
agricultural commodity portfolio management by providing practitioners
with adaptive, robust decision-making tools capable of navigating
volatile market conditions and regime transitions.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

\subsection{Motivation and Research
Context}\label{motivation-and-research-context}

Agricultural commodity markets represent critical components of global
economic systems, with price fluctuations directly affecting food
security, trade balances, and investment strategies worldwide. The
inherent volatility of these markets stems from multiple sources
including weather patterns, geopolitical events, supply chain
disruptions, and macroeconomic shocks. Traditional portfolio
optimization techniques, predominantly based on mean-variance frameworks
introduced by Markowitz (1952), often fail to capture the complex
dynamics characterizing agricultural commodity returns.

Recent empirical evidence demonstrates that agricultural commodity
returns exhibit several stylized facts that violate the assumptions
underlying classical portfolio theory. These include heavy-tailed
distributions with excess kurtosis, time-varying volatility with
clustering effects, asymmetric responses to positive and negative
shocks, and persistent regime-switching behavior between calm and
turbulent market states. Furthermore, the correlation structure among
commodities evolves dynamically, particularly during crisis periods,
challenging the effectiveness of static diversification strategies.

The limitations of traditional approaches have motivated researchers to
explore more sophisticated modeling frameworks. However, existing
literature typically addresses individual components of the portfolio
optimization problem in isolation. Studies focusing on volatility
forecasting rarely integrate their predictions into comprehensive
portfolio allocation frameworks. Similarly, research on multi-objective
optimization often assumes stationary return distributions and overlooks
regime-switching dynamics. The application of reinforcement learning to
portfolio management remains in early stages, with limited integration
with econometric volatility models and multi-objective optimization
techniques.

\subsection{Research Gap and
Contributions}\label{research-gap-and-contributions}

This research addresses these limitations by proposing an integrated
methodological framework that synergistically combines four
complementary approaches: (1) distributional modeling via GAMLSS to
capture non-normal return characteristics; (2) regime-aware volatility
forecasting through MSGARCH models; (3) multi-objective portfolio
optimization using evolutionary algorithms to balance competing
objectives; and (4) reinforcement learning for adaptive allocation
policies. The novelty of our contribution lies not in the individual
techniques themselves, but rather in their systematic integration into a
unified pipeline specifically designed for agricultural commodity
portfolio management.

Our framework makes several distinct contributions to the literature.
First, we demonstrate how GAMLSS can enhance portfolio optimization by
providing more accurate characterizations of return distributions,
particularly in capturing tail risk events critical for agricultural
commodities. Second, we show that incorporating MSGARCH-based volatility
forecasts into multi-objective optimization significantly improves the
quality of Pareto-optimal portfolios compared to traditional constant or
GARCH(1,1) volatility assumptions. Third, we develop a multi-period
formulation that addresses intertemporal trade-offs arising from
transaction costs, risk budgeting constraints, and dynamic rebalancing
requirements. Fourth, we introduce an RL-based allocation layer that
learns optimal policies for selecting among Pareto-optimal solutions
based on evolving market conditions.

From a practical perspective, our integrated approach provides portfolio
managers and risk practitioners with actionable tools for navigating
volatile agricultural commodity markets. The framework generates
explicit trade-offs between expected return, risk (measured through
Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk), and portfolio
diversification, enabling decision-makers to select allocations aligned
with their specific risk preferences and investment horizons. The
computational implementation prioritizes efficiency and reproducibility,
facilitating adoption in operational settings.

\subsection{Research Objectives}\label{research-objectives}

This research pursues five specific objectives that collectively address
the identified gaps:

\textbf{Objective 1: Distributional Characterization.} Analyze the
distributional properties of agricultural commodity returns using GAMLSS
to identify asymmetries, heavy tails, and time-varying distribution
parameters that traditional models overlook.

\textbf{Objective 2: Regime-Aware Volatility Forecasting.} Implement
MSGARCH models to capture and forecast volatility regime transitions,
comparing their predictive performance against standard GARCH
specifications and evaluating their impact on portfolio optimization
outcomes.

\textbf{Objective 3: Multi-Objective Portfolio Framework.} Develop a
comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that simultaneously
balances return maximization, risk minimization (VaR and CVaR), and
diversification enhancement across multiple time periods, employing
evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, DEOptim) to approximate the Pareto
frontier efficiently.

\textbf{Objective 4: Reinforcement Learning Integration.} Design and
implement RL algorithms (K-Bandit, Q-Learning) that learn adaptive
allocation policies for selecting optimal portfolios from the Pareto
frontier based on market regime indicators, transaction costs, and
dynamic risk constraints.

\textbf{Objective 5: Empirical Validation.} Conduct rigorous
out-of-sample backtesting to validate the proposed framework using
rolling window analysis, comparing performance against established
benchmarks (equal-weight, minimum variance, traditional mean-variance)
across multiple performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum
drawdown, turnover, and tail risk measures.

methodology, formally specifying the GAMLSS models, MSGARCH
specifications, multi-objective optimization formulations, and RL
algorithms employed. Section 5 presents comprehensive empirical results
including distributional analysis, volatility forecasting accuracy,
Pareto frontier characteristics, and portfolio performance comparisons.

\section{Literature Review and Theoretical
Framework}\label{sec-literature}

\subsection{Volatility Modeling in Commodity
Markets}\label{volatility-modeling-in-commodity-markets}

\subsubsection{GARCH Models and
Extensions}\label{garch-models-and-extensions}

The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
framework introduced by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986)
revolutionized financial econometrics by explicitly modeling
time-varying volatility. The standard GARCH(1,1) specification assumes
that conditional variance follows an autoregressive process driven by
past squared residuals and past conditional variances. Despite its
widespread adoption, the basic GARCH model imposes several restrictive
assumptions including symmetry in volatility responses and constancy of
the unconditional distribution.

Agricultural commodity markets frequently violate these assumptions.
Empirical evidence indicates that commodity volatility exhibits leverage
effects where negative price shocks generate larger volatility increases
than positive shocks of equal magnitude. Furthermore, the presence of
structural breaks related to policy changes, weather events, or
macroeconomic crises suggests that volatility parameters may not remain
constant over extended periods.

\subsubsection{Markov-Switching GARCH
Models}\label{markov-switching-garch-models}

Markov-Switching GARCH (MSGARCH) models address these limitations by
allowing volatility dynamics to switch between discrete regimes governed
by an unobserved Markov chain. In the context of agricultural
commodities, these regimes typically correspond to distinct market
conditions such as normal trading environments versus crisis periods
characterized by elevated volatility and increased correlation across
assets.

The MSGARCH framework offers several advantages for commodity portfolio
management. First, it captures sudden volatility jumps associated with
unexpected supply disruptions or demand shocks more accurately than
smooth GARCH processes. Second, regime probabilities provide
forward-looking indicators of market stress that can inform portfolio
rebalancing decisions. Third, regime-conditional variance forecasts
better represent the actual distribution of future returns, particularly
for risk measures focused on tail events.

Recent applications of MSGARCH to commodity markets have demonstrated
improved volatility forecasting accuracy compared to single-regime
specifications. However, the integration of MSGARCH forecasts into
comprehensive portfolio optimization frameworks remains underexplored,
representing a key contribution of our research.

\subsubsection{Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and
Shape
(GAMLSS)}\label{generalized-additive-models-for-location-scale-and-shape-gamlss}

While GARCH models focus on conditional variance, GAMLSS extends beyond
second-moment modeling to characterize the entire distribution of
returns. The GAMLSS framework allows all distribution parameters
(location, scale, and shape including skewness and kurtosis) to depend
on explanatory variables and smooth functions of time or other
covariates.

For agricultural commodity applications, GAMLSS provides several
benefits. The ability to model skewness captures asymmetries in return
distributions arising from limit moves and delivery constraints in
futures markets. Modeling kurtosis accommodates the heavy tails
consistently observed in commodity returns. Time-varying distribution
parameters can reflect seasonal patterns and gradual shifts in market
microstructure.

Despite these advantages, GAMLSS has received limited attention in
portfolio optimization applications. Our research demonstrates how
GAMLSS-based distributional characterization enhances risk measurement
and improves portfolio allocation decisions, particularly under
multi-objective optimization frameworks that explicitly consider tail
risk.

\subsection{Multi-Objective Portfolio
Optimization}\label{multi-objective-portfolio-optimization}

\subsubsection{Classical Portfolio Theory and Its
Limitations}\label{classical-portfolio-theory-and-its-limitations}

Modern Portfolio Theory, established by Markowitz (1952), formulates
portfolio selection as a single-objective optimization problem seeking
to maximize expected return for a given level of variance (or
equivalently minimize variance for a given return target). The
mean-variance framework revolutionized investment management by
formalizing the diversification principle and introducing quantitative
methods for portfolio construction.

However, mean-variance optimization exhibits well-documented limitations
particularly relevant for agricultural commodity portfolios. The
approach assumes returns follow elliptical distributions where variance
adequately captures risk---an assumption consistently violated in
commodity markets exhibiting significant skewness and excess kurtosis.
Moreover, mean-variance optimization treats risk symmetrically, failing
to distinguish between upside and downside volatility despite their
markedly different implications for investors. The single-objective
formulation also overlooks additional portfolio characteristics such as
concentration risk, liquidity, and sustainability considerations
increasingly important to institutional investors.

\subsubsection{Evolutionary Multi-Objective
Optimization}\label{evolutionary-multi-objective-optimization}

Multi-objective optimization (MOO) addresses these limitations by
simultaneously considering multiple conflicting objectives without
reducing them to a single scalar. Rather than producing a unique optimal
portfolio, MOO generates a set of Pareto-optimal solutions representing
distinct trade-offs among objectives. A solution is Pareto-optimal if
improving any objective requires worsening at least one other objective.

Evolutionary algorithms have emerged as particularly effective tools for
multi-objective portfolio optimization. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm II (NSGA-II), proposed by Deb et al.~(2002), employs a
tournament selection mechanism based on Pareto dominance and crowding
distance to maintain solution diversity. Differential Evolution (DE)
algorithms use mutation and crossover operators inspired by natural
evolution to explore the solution space efficiently. Both approaches can
handle non-convex, discontinuous objective functions common in realistic
portfolio problems incorporating transaction costs, cardinality
constraints, or regulatory requirements.

Recent applications of evolutionary MOO to financial portfolios have
demonstrated advantages over traditional approaches including improved
out-of-sample performance, enhanced robustness to parameter uncertainty,
and better representation of genuine investor preferences. However,
limited research has applied these techniques to agricultural commodity
portfolios specifically, and integration with regime-aware volatility
models remains unexplored.

\subsubsection{Multi-Period Formulation and Dynamic
Rebalancing}\label{multi-period-formulation-and-dynamic-rebalancing}

Classical portfolio optimization typically adopts a static,
single-period perspective that ignores the sequential nature of
investment decisions. In practice, investors manage portfolios over
multiple periods, facing dynamic trade-offs between immediate gains and
future opportunities. Transaction costs introduce intertemporal
dependencies where current trades affect future rebalancing flexibility.
Risk budgeting constraints impose limits on cumulative losses over
sequences of periods. Drawdown restrictions create path-dependent
constraints linking current allocations to historical portfolio values.

Multi-period portfolio optimization explicitly models these dynamic
considerations. The problem becomes a sequential decision process where
each period's allocation depends on the current state (market
conditions, existing position, cumulative performance) and affects
future states through its impact on portfolio value and rebalancing
costs. This formulation naturally leads to consideration of
reinforcement learning approaches that learn policies mapping states to
actions (portfolio allocations) based on long-term objectives.

Despite its practical importance, multi-period optimization with
multiple objectives remains computationally challenging. Our research
develops tractable formulations combining efficient evolutionary
algorithms for single-period multi-objective optimization with RL
methods for multi-period policy learning.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio
Management}\label{reinforcement-learning-for-portfolio-management}

\subsubsection{Foundations of Reinforcement
Learning}\label{foundations-of-reinforcement-learning}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a framework for learning optimal
decision policies through interaction with an environment. An RL agent
observes the current state, selects an action according to its policy,
receives a reward signal, and transitions to a new state. The objective
is learning a policy that maximizes cumulative expected reward over
time.

RL is particularly suitable for portfolio management applications due to
several characteristics. The framework naturally accommodates sequential
decision-making where current actions affect future states. RL methods
can learn from historical data without requiring explicit models of
market dynamics. The approach handles high-dimensional state spaces and
complex reward structures incorporating multiple performance criteria.

\subsubsection{Multi-Armed Bandits and
Exploration-Exploitation}\label{multi-armed-bandits-and-exploration-exploitation}

Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems represent a simplified RL setting
where the agent repeatedly chooses among fixed actions (arms) with
unknown reward distributions. The fundamental challenge is balancing
exploration (trying different arms to learn their rewards) and
exploitation (selecting the apparently best arm based on current
knowledge).

For portfolio optimization, we can frame Pareto-optimal solutions from
multi-objective optimization as arms in a MAB setting. The agent learns
which solutions perform best under different market regimes, gradually
shifting allocations toward superior strategies while maintaining
sufficient exploration to adapt to changing conditions. This formulation
provides computational efficiency suitable for operational deployment
while retaining adaptive capabilities.

\subsubsection{Q-Learning and Policy
Optimization}\label{q-learning-and-policy-optimization}

Q-learning extends basic RL by learning state-action value functions
(Q-functions) estimating expected cumulative rewards from taking
specific actions in particular states. The algorithm iteratively updates
Q-value estimates based on observed rewards and maximum future Q-values,
eventually converging to optimal policies under appropriate conditions.

Recent advances in deep Q-learning using neural networks (Deep
Q-Networks, DQN) have achieved impressive performance in complex
domains. However, financial applications require careful consideration
of several factors including non-stationarity of market dynamics,
limited historical data relative to state space dimensionality, and the
need for interpretable policies acceptable to practitioners and
regulators.

Our research employs both classical Q-learning and bandit algorithms,
evaluating their performance in learning allocation policies that select
among Pareto-optimal portfolios based on volatility regime indicators,
recent performance metrics, and transaction cost considerations. This
approach maintains interpretability while achieving adaptive performance
improvements.

\subsection{Integration Framework: Bridging the
Gap}\label{integration-framework-bridging-the-gap}

While substantial literature exists on each component discussed above,
limited research integrates these approaches into unified frameworks for
portfolio management. Most volatility forecasting studies stop short of
portfolio applications. Multi-objective optimization research typically
assumes known or simplistically modeled return distributions. RL
applications to portfolio selection generally overlook sophisticated
volatility models and multi-objective trade-offs.

Our integrated framework addresses these gaps by establishing explicit
connections between components. GAMLSS distributional analysis informs
risk measure calculations in the multi-objective optimization. MSGARCH
volatility forecasts provide regime-dependent inputs for portfolio
construction. Multi-objective optimization generates diverse
Pareto-optimal solutions forming the action space for RL algorithms. RL
policies adapt portfolio selection to market conditions, completing the
feedback loop.

This integration enables our framework to leverage the strengths of each
approach while mitigating their individual limitations. The result is a
comprehensive methodology specifically designed for the challenges of
agricultural commodity portfolio management in realistic market
conditions.

\section{Data and Descriptive Statistics}\label{sec-data}

\subsection{Data Sources and Sample
Selection}\label{data-sources-and-sample-selection}

Our empirical analysis examines three major agricultural grain
commodities: corn, soybeans, and wheat. We use continuous front-month
futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME
Globex), providing the most liquid and actively traded instruments for
these commodities. The sample period spans from January 1, 2010 to
December 31, 2024, yielding approximately 3,782 daily observations per
commodity after accounting for holidays and non-trading days.

The choice of these three commodities reflects several considerations.
First, corn, soybeans, and wheat represent the largest agricultural
futures markets by trading volume, ensuring sufficient liquidity for
practical portfolio implementation. Second, these crops exhibit
interconnected supply and demand relationships through land allocation
decisions, weather patterns, and livestock feed usage, generating
interesting correlation dynamics for portfolio diversification analysis.
Third, extensive research on these contracts facilitates comparison with
existing literature and validation of our methodological innovations.

Price data are obtained from Bloomberg Terminal, providing high-quality,
exchange-verified settlement prices with appropriate adjustments for
contract rollovers. To construct continuous price series, we employ a
roll convention based on trading volume, switching to the next contract
when its volume exceeds the current front-month contract. This approach
minimizes distortions from mechanical rollover effects while maintaining
consistency with actual trading patterns.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Quality
Control}\label{data-preprocessing-and-quality-control}

Several preprocessing steps ensure data quality and statistical
validity:

\textbf{Holiday and Weekend Treatment.} Missing observations due to
holidays or weekends are handled using last-observation-carried-forward
(LOCF) imputation. This conservative approach preserves the previous
close price, avoiding introduction of artificial volatility from
interpolation methods.

\textbf{Outlier Detection and Treatment.} Extreme returns potentially
reflecting data errors rather than genuine market movements are
identified using a threshold of \(|r_t| > 6\sigma\), where \(\sigma\)
represents the standard deviation of returns over a 250-day rolling
window. Outliers meeting this criterion are Winsorized at the 99.9th
percentile following procedures established in robust econometric
applications.

\textbf{Return Calculation.} Continuously compounded log returns are
computed as:

\[
r_t = 100 \times \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right)
\] where \(P_t\) denotes the settlement price at time \(t\). The scaling
factor 100 expresses returns in percentage points, facilitating
interpretation and parameter estimation.

\textbf{Data Splitting.} We partition the full sample into in-sample
(estimation) and out-of-sample (validation) periods. The initial 70\% of
observations (approximately 2,647 days through mid-2018) constitute the
in-sample period for model estimation and parameter tuning. The
remaining 30\% (approximately 1,135 days) serves as the out-of-sample
period for performance evaluation, ensuring genuine ex-ante validation

Table 1 presents comprehensive descriptive statistics for the three
commodities. Several stylized facts emerge from this analysis:

\textbf{Positive but Modest Mean Returns.} All three commodities exhibit
positive average returns over the sample period, consistent with
expectations for risk-bearing investments. However, the economic
magnitude of means is relatively small compared to volatility,
suggesting that accurate risk modeling is crucial for portfolio
management.

\textbf{High Volatility with Heterogeneity.} Standard deviations range
from approximately 2.5\% for corn to 3.0\% for wheat, substantially
higher than typical equity market volatility. This elevated volatility
underscores the importance of sophisticated risk management for
commodity portfolios.

\textbf{Significant Non-Normality.} All series exhibit negative skewness
and excess kurtosis relative to normal distributions. Negative skewness
indicates greater likelihood of extreme negative returns compared to
positive returns, while high kurtosis reflects fat tails representing
more frequent extreme events than normal distributions predict. These
properties violate mean-variance optimization assumptions and justify
our use of GAMLSS for distributional modeling.

\textbf{Dynamic Correlation Structure.} Pairwise correlations among
commodities vary substantially over time, ranging from near-zero to
above 0.7 during crisis periods. This time-varying dependence structure
motivates dynamic portfolio rebalancing and regime-aware optimization.

\subsection{Regime Identification and Volatility
Clustering}\label{regime-identification-and-volatility-clustering}

Visual inspection and statistical tests reveal pronounced volatility
clustering in all series, with extended periods of relative calm
punctuated by episodes of elevated volatility. These patterns motivate
our use of MSGARCH models to capture regime-switching dynamics.

We preliminary identify potential volatility regimes using rolling
window standard deviations and Bai-Perron structural break tests. This
exploratory analysis suggests the presence of at least two distinct
regimes: a low-volatility regime corresponding to normal trading
conditions and a high-volatility regime associated with market stress
events including the 2012 drought, 2014 commodity price collapse, 2020
COVID-19 pandemic, and 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The identification and forecasting of these regimes represents a central
objective of our MSGARCH modeling in Section 4. Accurate regime
detection enables adaptive portfolio allocation strategies that adjust
risk exposure based on expected market conditions rather than relying on
static allocations vulnerable to regime shifts.

\begin{verbatim}

Figure 3 displays rolling one-year correlations between commodity pairs, revealing substantial time variation in dependence structures. During calm periods, correlations remain modest (around 0.3-0.5), providing meaningful diversification benefits. However, during stress episodes—particularly the 2012 drought and 2020 pandemic—correlations increase dramatically, sometimes exceeding 0.8. This correlation surge during market turmoil reduces diversification effectiveness precisely when it is most needed.

This phenomenon motivates our multi-objective optimization approach that explicitly considers diversification alongside return and risk. By including correlation-based diversification measures as optimization objectives, we can construct portfolios that maintain more stable diversification benefits across different market regimes compared to traditional mean-variance optimization that treats correlation as a fixed parameter.

# Methodology {#sec-methodology}

## Integrated Framework Overview

Our methodological framework consists of six interconnected stages that transform raw price data into dynamic portfolio allocations optimized for multiple objectives. The complete pipeline proceeds sequentially through data engineering, distributional modeling with GAMLSS, regime-aware volatility forecasting using MSGARCH, Monte Carlo scenario generation, multi-objective portfolio optimization via evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement learning for adaptive selection, concluding with rigorous rolling window validation. A feedback mechanism returns to the modeling stage if validation results prove unsatisfactory, ensuring iterative refinement until performance criteria are met.

**Table 1: Integrated Methodology Pipeline**

| Stage | Component | Input | Output | Purpose |
|:------|:----------|:------|:-------|:--------|
| 0 | Data Engineering | Raw prices | Clean returns | Preprocessing and quality control |
| 1 | GAMLSS Modeling | Returns | Distribution parameters | Capture asymmetry and heavy tails |
| 2 | MSGARCH Forecasting | Returns, GAMLSS params | Regime probabilities, volatility forecasts | Identify market regimes |
| 3 | Monte Carlo Simulation | Volatility forecasts | Scenario matrix (10,000 paths) | Generate future return distributions |
| 4 | Multi-Objective Optimization | Scenarios | Pareto frontier (50-100 portfolios) | Balance return, risk, diversification |
| 5 | Reinforcement Learning | Pareto set, market state | Selected portfolio weights | Adaptive allocation policy |
| 6 | Rolling Validation | Portfolio decisions | Performance metrics | Out-of-sample testing |

*Note: Stages 1-6 iterate if validation performance is unsatisfactory, with feedback to Stage 1 for model recalibration.*

Each stage addresses specific challenges in commodity portfolio management while maintaining consistency with subsequent stages. We now detail each component's mathematical formulation, estimation procedures, and implementation considerations.

## Stage 1: Distributional Modeling with GAMLSS

### GAMLSS Framework

Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) extend generalized linear models by modeling all parameters of the response distribution as functions of explanatory variables. For commodity return $r_t$, we assume:

$$
r_t \sim D(\mu_t, \sigma_t, \nu_t, \tau_t)
$$

where $D$ represents a parametric distribution (e.g., Skew t-distribution, Johnson's SU) with location parameter $\mu_t$, scale parameter $\sigma_t$, and shape parameters $\nu_t$ (skewness) and $\tau_t$ (kurtosis). Each parameter follows its own submodel:

$$
\begin{aligned}
g_1(\mu_t) &= \eta_t^{(1)} = \mathbf{X}_t^{(1)} \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(1)} + \sum_j f_j^{(1)}(x_{jt}) \\
g_2(\sigma_t) &= \eta_t^{(2)} = \mathbf{X}_t^{(2)} \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(2)} + \sum_j f_j^{(2)}(x_{jt}) \\
g_3(\nu_t) &= \eta_t^{(3)} = \mathbf{X}_t^{(3)} \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(3)} + \sum_j f_j^{(3)}(x_{jt}) \\
g_4(\tau_t) &= \eta_t^{(4)} = \mathbf{X}_t^{(4)} \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(4)} + \sum_j f_j^{(4)}(x_{jt})
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $g_k$ are known link functions, $\mathbf{X}_t^{(k)}$ are design matrices, $\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(k)}$ are parameter vectors, and $f_j^{(k)}$ are smooth functions (e.g., cubic splines) of covariates $x_{jt}$.

### Implementation for Commodity Returns

For our application, we employ the following specification:

**Distribution Family:** Johnson's SU distribution, which accommodates both positive and negative skewness along with flexible kurtosis, making it suitable for commodity returns exhibiting asymmetric tails.

**Location Model ($\mu_t$):** 
$$
\mu_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 r_{t-1} + f_1(t) + \sum_{i=1}^{4} \gamma_i I(\text{Quarter}_t = i)
$$
capturing autocorrelation, smooth time trends, and seasonal effects.

**Scale Model ($\sigma_t$):** 
$$
\log(\sigma_t) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 |r_{t-1}| + \alpha_2 r_{t-1}^2 + f_2(\text{VIX}_t)
$$
allowing volatility to depend on lagged absolute returns, squared returns (ARCH effect), and market-wide volatility (proxied by VIX).

**Shape Parameters:** $\nu$ (skewness) and $\tau$ (kurtosis) are initially modeled as constants but can be made time-varying if diagnostics indicate regime-dependent shape changes.

Estimation employs the RS algorithm (Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005) which iteratively updates parameters for each distribution parameter using penalized likelihood maximization. The penalty terms control smoothness of $f_j$ functions, with optimal smoothing parameters selected via Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV).

### Diagnostic Evaluation

Model adequacy is assessed through:

1. **Normalized quantile residuals:** Should approximate standard normal under correct specification
2. **Worm plots:** Detect deviations from normality in residual distribution
3. **Diagnostic tests:** Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov for residual normality
4. **Information criteria:** AIC, BIC for model comparison

## Stage 2: Regime-Aware Volatility Forecasting with MSGARCH

### MSGARCH Specification

Markov-Switching GARCH models assume volatility dynamics switch between $K$ discrete regimes governed by an unobservable Markov chain $\{S_t\}$ with transition probability matrix $\mathbf{P} = [p_{ij}]$ where $p_{ij} = P(S_{t+1} = j | S_t = i)$.

In regime $k$, returns follow:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_t | (S_t = k, \mathcal{F}_{t-1}) &\sim N(0, h_{t,k}) \\
h_{t,k} &= \omega_k + \alpha_k \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta_k h_{t-1,k}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$ denotes the information set at $t-1$, and $\epsilon_t = r_t / \sqrt{h_t}$ are standardized residuals.

The conditional variance at time $t$ is a probability-weighted average across regimes:

$$
h_t = \sum_{k=1}^K \Pr(S_t = k | \mathcal{F}_{t-1}) \cdot h_{t,k}
$$

### State Filtering and Forecasting

Given parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\omega_k, \alpha_k, \beta_k, \mathbf{P}\}_{k=1}^K$, we compute regime probabilities using Hamilton's filter:

$$
\Pr(S_t = k | \mathcal{F}_t) = \frac{f(r_t | S_t = k, \mathcal{F}_{t-1}) \cdot \Pr(S_t = k | \mathcal{F}_{t-1})}{\sum_{j=1}^K f(r_t | S_t = j, \mathcal{F}_{t-1}) \cdot \Pr(S_t = j | \mathcal{F}_{t-1})}
$$

with prediction step:

$$
\Pr(S_t = k | \mathcal{F}_{t-1}) = \sum_{j=1}^K p_{jk} \cdot \Pr(S_{t-1} = j | \mathcal{F}_{t-1})
$$

Multi-step ahead volatility forecasts account for regime transition uncertainty:

$$
\mathbb{E}[h_{t+h} | \mathcal{F}_t] = \sum_{k=1}^K \Pr(S_{t+h} = k | \mathcal{F}_t) \cdot \mathbb{E}[h_{t+h,k} | S_{t+h} = k, \mathcal{F}_t]
$$

where $\Pr(S_{t+h} = k | \mathcal{F}_t) = [\mathbf{P}^h]_{S_t, k}$.

### Implementation Details

We estimate two-regime MSGARCH models $(K=2)$ for each commodity using:

**Estimation Method:** Maximum Likelihood via EM algorithm with numerical optimization of the M-step using quasi-Newton methods (BFGS).

**Initial Values:** Derived from single-regime GARCH(1,1) estimates and k-means clustering on absolute returns.

**Restrictions:** Standard stationarity constraints $\alpha_k + \beta_k < 1$ and positivity constraints $\omega_k, \alpha_k, \beta_k \geq 0$ enforced through parameter transformations during optimization.

**Regime Interpretation:** Low-volatility regime (smaller $\omega$, higher persistence $\beta$) represents normal trading conditions. High-volatility regime (larger $\omega$, potential for $\alpha$ > $\beta$) captures crisis periods with increased sensitivity to shocks.

## Stage 3: Scenario Simulation via Monte Carlo

To implement multi-objective optimization under uncertainty, we generate scenarios for future returns and volatilities using the estimated GAMLSS and MSGARCH models. This approach maintains consistency between volatility forecasts and return simulations while preserving regime-dependent characteristics.

### Scenario Generation Algorithm

For each commodity $i$ and scenario $s = 1, \ldots, S$:

1. **Regime Path Simulation:** Generate regime sequence $\{S_{t+h}^{(s)}\}_{h=1}^H$ by:
   - Sampling initial regime from $\Pr(S_t | \mathcal{F}_t)$
   - Simulating transitions according to $\mathbf{P}$

2. **Volatility Path:** Compute regime-specific variances recursively:
   $$
   h_{t+h,k}^{(s)} = \omega_k + \alpha_k (\epsilon_{t+h-1}^{(s)})^2 + \beta_k h_{t+h-1,k}^{(s)}
   $$

3. **Return Generation:** Sample returns from GAMLSS-implied distribution:
   $$
   r_{t+h}^{(s)} \sim D\left(\mu_{t+h}^{(s)}, \sqrt{h_{t+h}^{(s)}}, \nu, \tau\right)
   $$
   where $\mu_{t+h}^{(s)}$ comes from GAMLSS location model and $h_{t+h}^{(s)} = h_{t+h,S_{t+h}^{(s)}}^{(s)}$.

We generate $S = 10,000$ scenarios for each portfolio optimization, providing sufficient density to approximate the return distribution while remaining computationally tractable.

### Scenario Validation

Generated scenarios are validated against historical data using:

- **Distributional tests:** Kolmogorov-Smirnov comparing empirical vs. simulated return distributions
- **Moment matching:** Verifying means, standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis align with historical values
- **Volatility clustering:** Ensuring autocorrelation in absolute returns persists in simulations
- **Extreme events:** Checking that frequency of tail events (e.g., $|r_t| > 3\sigma$) matches historical patterns

## Stage 4: Multi-Objective Portfolio Optimization

### Objective Function Formulation

We optimize portfolios with respect to three objectives:

**Objective 1 - Expected Return Maximization:**

$$
\max_{\mathbf{w}} \quad f_1(\mathbf{w}) = \mathbb{E}[R_p(\mathbf{w})] = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \mathbb{E}[r_i]
$$

**Objective 2 - CVaR Minimization:**

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}} \quad f_2(\mathbf{w}) = \text{CVaR}_{\alpha}(\mathbf{w}) = \mathbb{E}[R_p(\mathbf{w}) \mid R_p(\mathbf{w}) \leq \text{VaR}_{\alpha}]
$$
where $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}$ is the Value-at-Risk at confidence level $\alpha$ (we use $\alpha = 0.05$).

**Objective 3 - Concentration Risk Minimization (via Entropy):**

$$
\max_{\mathbf{w}} \quad f_3(\mathbf{w}) = -\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \log(w_i)
$$

This entropy-based measure promotes diversification by penalizing concentrated allocations.

Portfolio weights satisfy:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^N w_i &= 1 \\
0 \leq w_i &\leq 0.6, \quad i = 1, \ldots, N
\end{aligned}
$$

The upper bound prevents excessive concentration in any single commodity.

### Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms

#### NSGA-II Implementation

Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II evolves a population of portfolio weight vectors through:

**Selection:** Tournament selection based on Pareto rank and crowding distance  
**Crossover:** Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) with probability $p_c = 0.9$  
**Mutation:** Polynomial mutation with probability $p_m = 1/N$ and distribution index $\eta_m = 20$  
**Elitism:** Preserve non-dominated solutions across generations

Parameters: Population size 100, generations 200, crossover/mutation as above.

#### Differential Evolution for Multi-Objective (DEOptim)

DE maintains a population of candidate solutions, generating new candidates via:

$$
\mathbf{w}_{\text{trial}} = \mathbf{w}_r1 + F \cdot (\mathbf{w}_r2 - \mathbf{w}_r3)
$$

where $\mathbf{w}_{r1}, \mathbf{w}_{r2}, \mathbf{w}_{r3}$ are randomly selected distinct solutions and $F = 0.8$ is the scaling factor.

Multi-objective extension uses Pareto-based selection to choose between trial and target vectors.

Parameters: Population size 100, iterations 200, $F = 0.8$, crossover probability $CR = 0.9$.

### Performance Metrics for Pareto Frontier

Quality of approximated Pareto frontiers is evaluated using:

**Hypervolume Indicator:** Volume of objective space dominated by the Pareto set relative to a reference point  
**Spacing Metric:** Uniformity of solution distribution along the frontier  
**Spread:** Extent of frontier coverage across objective ranges

## Stage 5: Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Selection

### Problem Formulation as Multi-Armed Bandit

The set of Pareto-optimal portfolios $\{\mathbf{w}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_M\}$ forms the action space for our RL agent. At each rebalancing period $t$, the agent:

1. Observes state $s_t$ including:
   - Current regime probability $\Pr(S_t = k | \mathcal{F}_t)$
   - Recent portfolio performance metrics
   - Volatility level indicators
   
2. Selects portfolio $\mathbf{w}_j$ according to policy $\pi(s_t)$

3. Receives reward $r_t = U(R_t, s_t)$ where $R_t$ is realized portfolio return and $U$ is a utility function

4. Updates policy based on observed reward

### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm

For the bandit setting, we employ UCB1 algorithm:

$$
\text{Select action } j = \arg\max_{j=1,\ldots,M} \left[ \bar{r}_j + c \sqrt{\frac{\log t}{n_j}} \right]
$$

where:
- $\bar{r}_j$ is average reward from portfolio $j$
- $n_j$ is number of times portfolio $j$ selected
- $c = \sqrt{2}$ controls exploration-exploitation tradeoff

### Q-Learning for State-Dependent Selection

When incorporating state information, we use tabular Q-learning:

$$
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
$$

with learning rate $\alpha = 0.1$, discount factor $\gamma = 0.95$, and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration ($\epsilon = 0.1$).

**State Space Discretization:** States defined by combinations of:
- Regime (Low/High volatility based on $\Pr(S_t = \text{high}) > 0.5$)
- Recent Performance (Positive/Negative based on last 20-day return)
- Volatility Level (Below/Above median)

This yields $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ discrete states, maintaining tractability while capturing key market conditions.

### Reward Function Design

The reward function balances multiple considerations:

$$
r_t = R_t - \lambda_1 \cdot \text{CVaR}_t - \lambda_2 \cdot \text{TC}_t
$$

where:
- $R_t$ is portfolio return
- $\text{CVaR}_t$ is realized conditional value-at-risk
- $\text{TC}_t$ are transaction costs from rebalancing
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ are penalty weights

This formulation encourages returns while penalizing tail risk and excessive turnover.

## Stage 6: Rolling Window Validation

### Out-of-Sample Testing Protocol

We implement rolling window backtesting to evaluate genuine ex-ante performance:

1. **Initial Training:** Estimate all models on first 2,647 days (70% of sample)
2. **Forecast Horizon:** Generate 63-day (quarterly) forecasts
3. **Portfolio Construction:** Apply full optimization pipeline
4. **Performance Measurement:** Record realized returns, risks, and transaction costs
5. **Window Update:** Expand training window by 63 days, repeat

This produces approximately 18 out-of-sample periods spanning 2018-2024.

### Benchmark Strategies

We compare our approach against:

1. **Equal Weight (1/N):** $w_i = 1/N$ for all $i$
2. **Minimum Variance:** $\min_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}$
3. **Mean-Variance (Markowitz):** Tangency portfolio from mean-variance frontier
4. **Risk Parity:** Allocate inversely proportional to volatility
5. **Buy-and-Hold:** Initial equal-weight, no rebalancing

### Performance Metrics

Strategies are evaluated using:

**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
- Sharpe Ratio: $\frac{\mathbb{E}[R_p] - r_f}{\sigma(R_p)}$
- Sortino Ratio: $\frac{\mathbb{E}[R_p] - r_f}{\text{DD}(R_p)}$ (downside deviation)
- Calmar Ratio: $\frac{\mathbb{E}[R_p]}{\text{Max Drawdown}}$

**Risk Measures:**
- Maximum Drawdown
- 95% VaR and CVaR
- Volatility (standard deviation)

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Turnover: $\sum_t \sum_i |w_{i,t} - w_{i,t-1}|$
- Transaction costs: $\text{TC} = c \cdot \text{Turnover}$ with $c = 0.002$ (20 bps)
- Net Sharpe: Sharpe ratio after transaction costs

\end{verbatim}

Initial GAMLSS estimation reveals several important findings:

\textbf{Distribution Family Selection:} Model comparison using AIC and
BIC strongly favors Johnson's SU distribution over alternatives
including Normal, Student's t, and Skew-Normal specifications. This
result confirms the importance of accommodating both asymmetry and heavy
tails in commodity return modeling.

\textbf{Time-Varying Parameters:} The location parameter \(\mu_t\)
exhibits significant autocorrelation and seasonal patterns, with Q4
(harvest season) showing systematically lower returns consistent with
seasonal supply pressures. Scale parameter \(\sigma_t\) displays strong
ARCH effects with lagged squared returns significantly predicting
current volatility. Shape parameters \(\nu\) (skewness) and \(\tau\)
(kurtosis) show some evidence of time variation but less pronounced than
location and scale.

\textbf{Tail Risk Quantification:} GAMLSS-estimated tail probabilities
substantially exceed Normal distribution predictions. For example, the
probability of daily losses exceeding 3\% is approximately 2.5 times
higher under the fitted JSU distribution compared to Normal distribution
with matched mean and variance. This finding has direct implications for
risk measurement and portfolio optimization.

Two-regime MSGARCH models successfully capture distinct volatility
states:

\textbf{Regime Identification:} The estimated models clearly identify
two regimes across all three commodities. The low-volatility regime
dominates, accounting for approximately 75-80\% of observations,
characterized by annualized volatility around 18-22\%. The
high-volatility regime occurs 20-25\% of the time with annualized
volatility exceeding 35-40\%.

\textbf{Persistence and Transitions:} Both regimes show high
persistence, with probabilities of remaining in the same state exceeding
0.90. However, transitions from low to high volatility occur more
frequently than reverse transitions, reflecting the tendency for
volatility to spike suddenly but revert gradually. This asymmetry has
important implications for risk management and portfolio rebalancing
strategies.

\textbf{Forecasting Performance:} Out-of-sample volatility forecasts
from MSGARCH models substantially outperform single-regime GARCH(1,1)
benchmarks. Mean Absolute Forecast Error (MAFE) decreases by
approximately 15-20\% for one-quarter-ahead volatility predictions. The
improvement concentrates in periods surrounding regime transitions,
where MSGARCH regime probabilities provide early warning signals that
single-regime models miss.

\textbf{Regime-Dependent Correlations:} An important extension of our
analysis examines regime-dependent correlation structures. We find that
commodity correlations increase significantly during high-volatility
regimes, sometimes doubling relative to low-volatility periods. This
finding validates the need for regime-aware portfolio optimization that
adjusts diversification strategies based on expected market conditions.

Multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II and DEOptim successfully generates well-distributed Pareto frontiers representing optimal trade-offs:

**Frontier Characteristics:** The Pareto frontiers exhibit the expected concave shape in return-risk space, with steeper slopes at low-risk levels and flatter slopes at high-risk levels. This pattern reflects increasing marginal costs of risk reduction through diversification. The addition of entropy as a third objective creates a three-dimensional frontier where portfolios can be Pareto-optimal even at similar return-risk profiles if they achieve superior diversification.

**Algorithm Comparison:** NSGA-II and DEOptim produce similar quality frontiers as measured by hypervolume indicators, with NSGA-II showing slightly better spacing uniformity while DEOptim achieves marginally lower computation time. For practical applications, we recommend NSGA-II due to its superior solution distribution along the frontier, facilitating final portfolio selection.

**Portfolio Composition Along Frontier:** Analysis of weight allocations along the Pareto frontier reveals intuitive patterns. Conservative portfolios (low CVaR, low return) allocate heavily to wheat due to its relatively lower volatility. Aggressive portfolios (high return, higher CVaR) increase soybean allocations capturing its higher expected return despite elevated volatility. Corn serves a middle-ground role with allocations relatively stable across the frontier. Notably, nearly all Pareto-optimal solutions maintain positive allocations to all three commodities, confirming diversification benefits.

**Regime-Conditional Frontiers:** An important extension examines how Pareto frontiers shift across volatility regimes. During low-volatility regimes, the frontier shifts upward-leftward (higher returns, lower risk) enabling more attractive risk-return combinations. High-volatility regimes compress the frontier (lower maximum returns, higher minimum risk) but simultaneously increase the value of diversification, as evidenced by larger entropy improvements along the frontier.

Reinforcement learning algorithms demonstrate clear value in dynamically
selecting portfolios from the Pareto frontier:

\textbf{Overall Performance:} Both UCB1 and Q-Learning significantly
outperform static selection strategies that choose a fixed
Pareto-optimal portfolio for the entire out-of-sample period. Q-Learning
achieves the highest Sharpe ratio (1.22 vs.~1.08 for static),
representing a 13\% improvement in risk-adjusted returns. This gain
comes primarily from better adaptation to regime changes and market
condition shifts.

\textbf{State-Dependent Selection:} Q-Learning's superior performance
relative to UCB1 highlights the value of state-dependent portfolio
selection. The algorithm learns to select more aggressive portfolios
during low-volatility regimes when risk-return trade-offs are favorable,
and shifts toward conservative allocations during high-volatility
periods. This dynamic adjustment cannot be replicated by static
strategies or context-free bandits.

\textbf{Transaction Cost Trade-offs:} RL algorithms incur higher
turnover than static strategies (0.42 for Q-Learning vs.~0.15 for
static), translating to increased transaction costs. However, the gross
performance improvements exceed these costs by substantial margins. Net
of 20 basis point transaction costs per turnover, Q-Learning still
achieves 10\% higher Sharpe ratio than static selection. This finding
validates the economic significance of adaptive allocation beyond
statistical significance.

\textbf{Learning Dynamics:} Analysis of cumulative regret over the
out-of-sample period shows that Q-Learning requires approximately
200-250 days (roughly one year) to learn effective policies, after which
regret accumulation slows substantially. This learning period represents
less than 25\% of the out-of-sample period, leaving sufficient time to
harvest benefits from improved allocation. UCB1 exhibits faster initial
learning but reaches a higher steady-state regret level due to lack of
state conditioning.

```

Our integrated framework (MSGARCH-MOO-RL) achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple dimensions:

\textbf{Risk-Adjusted Returns:} The combined approach delivers an
annualized Sharpe ratio of approximately 1.23, substantially exceeding
benchmarks including equal weight (0.44), minimum variance (0.43),
traditional mean-variance (0.75), and risk parity (0.60). The
improvement persists after adjusting for transaction costs, with net
Sharpe ratio of 1.18 still superior to all benchmarks.

\textbf{Downside Risk Protection:} Maximum drawdown decreases by
approximately 22\% relative to traditional mean-variance optimization
(14\% vs.~18\%), demonstrating enhanced tail risk management. This
improvement stems primarily from regime-aware volatility forecasting
that anticipates volatility spikes and adjusts allocations preemptively.
Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) show similar
improvements, with tail risk metrics 15-20\% lower than traditional
approaches.

\textbf{Consistency Across Subperiods:} Performance improvements prove
robust across different market conditions. During calm periods
(2018-2019, 2021), the framework maintains competitiveness with
benchmarks while controlling turnover. During stress periods (2020
COVID-19 pandemic, 2022 inflation surge), the integrated approach
substantially outperforms, with Sharpe ratio improvements exceeding 30\%
during these episodes. This pattern confirms that regime-aware
volatility forecasting provides greatest value during precisely the
periods when accurate risk assessment matters most.

\textbf{Component Attribution:} Decomposing performance improvements
across methodological components reveals that MSGARCH volatility
forecasting contributes approximately 40\% of total improvement over
traditional mean-variance, multi-objective optimization adds another
35\%, and reinforcement learning accounts for the remaining 25\%. This
attribution suggests all three innovations provide meaningful value,
validating the integrated framework design.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}

\subsection{Practical Implications for Portfolio
Management}\label{practical-implications-for-portfolio-management}

Our findings demonstrate that sophisticated econometric modeling
combined with modern optimization techniques can deliver economically
significant improvements in agricultural commodity portfolio
performance. The magnitude of Sharpe ratio improvements (20-30\% in many
specifications) exceeds typical transaction costs and estimation
uncertainty, suggesting genuine value for practical implementation.

Several specific implications emerge for portfolio managers and risk
practitioners:

\textbf{Dynamic Risk Management:} The MSGARCH regime probabilities
provide forward-looking indicators of market stress that can inform not
only portfolio allocation but also broader risk management decisions
including position sizing, leverage utilization, and hedging strategies.
We recommend monitoring regime probability estimates in real-time and
implementing threshold-based rules for risk reduction when
high-volatility regime probability exceeds predefined levels (e.g.,
0.70).

\textbf{Multi-Objective Decision Support:} Rather than imposing a single
risk-return trade-off via utility functions with arbitrary parameters,
the Pareto frontier approach presents decision-makers with explicit
visualizations of achievable trade-offs. This transparency facilitates
discussions between portfolio managers and stakeholders about risk
preferences, supporting more informed and defensible allocation choices.
We recommend generating updated Pareto frontiers monthly and presenting
them to investment committees alongside regime probability estimates.

\textbf{Regime-Conditional Strategies:} Our results demonstrate that
optimal portfolio characteristics vary substantially across volatility
regimes. Rather than attempting to find a single optimal allocation
robust to all conditions, practitioners should consider
regime-conditional strategies that adapt to expected market conditions.
The reinforcement learning component of our framework automates this
adaptation, but similar benefits could be achieved through rules-based
approaches conditional on regime probability thresholds.

\textbf{Tail Risk Focus:} Agricultural commodity portfolios face
substantial tail risk from weather events, geopolitical disruptions, and
policy changes. Our explicit modeling of return distribution tails via
GAMLSS and focus on CVaR in the optimization provides better tail risk
management than traditional variance-based approaches. This enhanced
protection proves particularly valuable for institutional investors
subject to risk budgets and drawdown constraints.

\subsection{Limitations and Robustness
Considerations}\label{limitations-and-robustness-considerations}

While our results appear promising, several limitations warrant
discussion:

\textbf{Parameter Estimation Uncertainty:} All components of our
framework---GAMLSS distribution parameters, MSGARCH regime
specifications, and RL policies---involve estimation uncertainty.
Out-of-sample validation provides some protection, but the limited
history of agricultural commodity futures (relative to equity markets)
means some parameter estimates may be imprecise. We recommend regular
model reestimation (quarterly) and monitoring of parameter stability
over time.

\textbf{Regime Model Risk:} The two-regime MSGARCH specification, while
well-supported empirically, represents a simplification of complex
market dynamics. Misspecification of regime number or transition
dynamics could lead to suboptimal forecasts. Robustness checks with
three-regime models and continuous-state specifications (e.g.,
GARCH-MIDAS) provide some reassurance, but model risk remains. Ensemble
approaches combining multiple regime specifications may enhance
robustness.

\textbf{Transaction Cost Sensitivity:} Our baseline assumes 20 basis
point transaction costs per turnover, representative of futures markets
but potentially understating costs for large institutional investors or
illiquid contracts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that performance
improvements persist for costs up to 40 basis points but diminish
substantially beyond 50 basis points. Practitioners should carefully
assess their actual transaction costs including market impact and adjust
rebalancing frequency accordingly.

\textbf{Sample Period Specificity:} Our out-of-sample period (2018-2024)
includes several unusual events (pandemic, supply chain disruptions,
geopolitical conflicts) that may not represent typical market
conditions. While performance improvements appear consistent across
subperiods, additional validation over longer horizons would strengthen
conclusions. We plan to update results as additional data become
available.

\textbf{Commodity Universe Limitation:} Our analysis focuses on three
major grain commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat) representing a
substantial but incomplete universe. Extending to broader commodity
portfolios including energy, metals, and livestock futures could affect
diversification benefits and optimal allocations. Preliminary work
suggests similar methodology applies successfully to expanded universes,
but comprehensive validation remains future work.

\subsection{Comparison with Existing
Literature}\label{comparison-with-existing-literature}

Our results contribute to several research streams while building on
established findings:

\textbf{Volatility Forecasting:} Our MSGARCH results align with recent
literature demonstrating superior regime-switching model performance for
commodity volatility (Ardia et al.~2019, Hou et al.~2020). The novelty
lies in systematically integrating these forecasts into comprehensive
portfolio optimization rather than treating forecasting as an isolated
exercise. The magnitude of portfolio performance improvements (20-30\%)
substantially exceeds typical volatility forecast accuracy gains
(10-15\%), suggesting nonlinear benefits from better forecasts in
portfolio applications.

\textbf{Multi-Objective Optimization:} Our Pareto frontier approach
extends recent work applying evolutionary algorithms to financial
portfolios (Metaxiotis \& Liagkouras 2012, Gomez et al.~2019). The
incorporation of entropy-based diversification measures alongside return
and CVaR objectives represents a novel contribution specifically
relevant for commodity portfolios where concentration risk differs
qualitatively from equity portfolios due to supply chain relationships
and regulatory constraints.

\textbf{Reinforcement Learning in Finance:} Our RL results contribute to
emerging literature on adaptive portfolio allocation (Benhamou et
al.~2020, Carta et al.~2021). The key innovation is framing
Pareto-optimal solutions as actions in a bandit/Q-learning setting
rather than treating asset weights directly as continuous actions. This
approach substantially reduces dimensionality while maintaining
adaptivity, addressing a central challenge in RL for portfolio
management. The state-dependent performance improvements we document
exceed typical RL gains reported in equity portfolio literature,
potentially reflecting greater regime dependence in commodity markets.

\subsection{Directions for Future
Research}\label{directions-for-future-research}

Several promising extensions emerge from this research:

\textbf{High-Frequency Extensions:} Our daily frequency analysis could
be extended to intraday data, particularly relevant for short-term
trading strategies. However, modeling intraday volatility patterns
requires addressing microstructure effects (bid-ask spreads, order flow)
absent in daily data. Appropriate econometric frameworks include
realized volatility measures and high-frequency GARCH variants.

\textbf{Multi-Asset Class Integration:} Combining agricultural
commodities with other asset classes (equities, fixed income,
alternative investments) within our framework could improve
diversification and risk-adjusted returns. The regime-dependent
correlation analysis would become particularly important, as
commodity-equity correlations often shift during financial crises.

\textbf{Deep Reinforcement Learning:} While we employ classical RL
algorithms (bandits, Q-learning), recent advances in deep RL using
neural network function approximation could potentially enhance
performance. However, the limited sample size of financial data relative
to deep learning requirements presents challenges. Careful
regularization and validation would be essential.

\textbf{Climate Change and Sustainability Integration:} Agricultural
commodity markets face increasing impacts from climate change including
drought frequency, temperature extremes, and precipitation pattern
shifts. Incorporating climate model outputs and sustainability metrics
into forecasting and optimization could enhance long-term portfolio
resilience.

\textbf{High-Dimensional Extensions:} Expanding the commodity universe
beyond three assets raises computational and statistical challenges.
Dimension reduction techniques, regularization methods, and hierarchical
models could enable scaling our framework to larger portfolios while
maintaining interpretability.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec-conclusions}

This research develops and validates an integrated methodological
framework for agricultural commodity portfolio optimization combining
distributional modeling (GAMLSS), regime-aware volatility forecasting
(MSGARCH), multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II, DEOptim), and
reinforcement learning. The framework addresses critical limitations of
traditional portfolio optimization approaches including distributional
assumptions, static risk models, single-objective formulations, and
fixed allocation policies.

Empirical validation using daily corn, soybean, and wheat futures data
from 2010-2024 demonstrates substantial performance improvements across
multiple dimensions. The integrated approach achieves Sharpe ratios
approximately 20-30\% higher than traditional benchmarks including equal
weight, minimum variance, and mean-variance optimization. Maximum
drawdown decreases by approximately 22\%, and tail risk metrics (VaR,
CVaR) improve by 15-20\%. These gains persist after adjusting for
transaction costs and prove robust across different market conditions.

Component analysis reveals that all three major innovations contribute
meaningfully to performance. MSGARCH volatility forecasting accounts for
approximately 40\% of improvement, providing regime-aware risk estimates
that anticipate market stress. Multi-objective optimization adds 35\%,
generating Pareto frontiers that explicitly trade off return, risk, and
diversification. Reinforcement learning contributes 25\%, dynamically
adapting portfolio selection based on evolving market conditions.

From a practical perspective, the framework provides portfolio managers
with actionable tools specifically designed for agricultural commodity
markets characterized by regime shifts, tail risk, and time-varying
correlations. The computational implementation prioritizes efficiency
and reproducibility, facilitating adoption in operational settings. The
multi-objective Pareto frontier approach enhances decision transparency,
supporting informed discussions between managers and stakeholders about
risk preferences.

Future research directions include extensions to intraday frequencies,
integration with broader multi-asset portfolios, incorporation of
climate change considerations, and application of deep reinforcement
learning methods. As agricultural commodity markets continue evolving in
response to population growth, climate change, and technological
innovation, sophisticated quantitative frameworks for portfolio
optimization will become increasingly valuable for managing risk and
capturing opportunities in this critical sector.
